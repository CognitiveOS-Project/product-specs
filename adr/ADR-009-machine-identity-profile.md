# ADR-009: Machine Identity Profile and Gated Publisher Model

**Status:** Proposed
**Date:** 2026-07-20
**Author:** CognitiveOS SDLC

## Context

Today, any machine that generates an SSH key can `cpm auth register` and immediately `cpm publish` to the registry. There is no gating, no approval, and no identity beyond the key itself. This creates a supply chain risk — unvetted machines can publish packages to the official registry.

The current auth flow:

```
Machine generates SSH key → cpm auth register → cpm publish
                                                   ↑
                                              No gate here
```

We need a **signup layer** that evaluates both the machine and its owner before granting publish access.

## Decision

Introduce a machine identity profile and gated publisher model. Before a machine can register keys and publish, it must sign up with the registry server. The server evaluates the machine's hardware/software profile and the owner's identity against configurable rules.

### Core Insight: What a Machine Has

A machine has three inherent properties:

| Property | What it is | Why it matters |
|----------|-----------|----------------|
| **Hardware** | CPU, RAM, storage, GPU, TPM, network interfaces | Proves physical capability and origin |
| **Software** | OS, kernel, packages, cpm version, running services | Proves operational environment |
| **Owner** | The person who controls the machine | Accountability — who is responsible for this machine's actions |

The machine's identity IS its profile. Not a stored credential. Not an email. The machine itself, plus the person who owns it.

### Owner Identity

The owner identifies themselves via their SSH public key. This is consistent with the existing auth model — both machine and owner have cryptographic identities. No email, no password, no OAuth.

The owner's key serves two purposes:
1. **Identity** — "who owns this machine"
2. **Accountability** — "who is responsible if this machine publishes something malicious"

### New Flow

```
Machine                          Registry Server
  │                                     │
  │  1. cpm signup                      │
  │  → gathers machine profile          │
  │     (hardware + software)           │
  │  → gathers owner identity           │
  │     (owner's SSH public key)        │
  │  → signs profile with machine key   │
  │  → POST /v1/auth/signup             │
  │  ─────────────────────────────────► │
  │                                     │
  │                                     │  2. Evaluate:
  │                                     │     - machine profile
  │                                     │     - owner identity
  │                                     │     against rules
  │                                     │
  │  ◄── 200 Approved ─────────────────│  (or 403 Rejected)
  │                                     │
  │  3. cpm auth register               │
  │  → POST /v1/auth/register           │
  │  ─────────────────────────────────► │
  │                                     │  4. Verify signup
  │                                     │     status = approved
  │                                     │     Store key
  │  ◄── 201 Key registered ───────────│
  │                                     │
  │  5. cpm publish                     │
  │  → SSH signed request               │
  │  ─────────────────────────────────► │
  │                                     │  6. Verify key is
  │                                     │     registered + approved
  │  ◄── 201 Published ────────────────│
```

### Machine Identity Profile

The machine gathers its inherent properties during `cpm signup`:

```json
{
  "machine": {
    "hardware": {
      "cpu": "AMD Ryzen 9 5900X 12-Core",
      "cores": 24,
      "arch": "amd64",
      "ram_mb": 65536,
      "storage_mb": 1000000,
      "gpu": "NVIDIA RTX 3090",
      "tpm": true,
      "machine_id": "a1b2c3d4-..."
    },
    "software": {
      "os": "linux",
      "kernel": "6.12.0",
      "distro": "alpine",
      "cpm_version": "0.1.0",
      "packages": ["docker", "go", "python3"],
      "services": ["sshd", "docker"]
    },
    "network": {
      "ip": "192.168.1.100"
    }
  },
  "owner": {
    "public_key": "ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAIG8...",
    "fingerprint": "SHA256:abc123...",
    "comment": "jean@cognitive-os.org"
  }
}
```

### Data Collection

`cpm signup` collects from the machine:

| Source | Data | Mechanism |
|--------|------|-----------|
| CPU | Model, cores | `/proc/cpuinfo`, `lscpu` |
| RAM | Total MB | `/proc/meminfo` |
| Storage | Total/free MB | `statfs()` |
| GPU | Model, VRAM | `lspci`, `nvidia-smi` |
| TPM | Present | `/sys/class/tpm/` |
| Machine ID | Unique identifier | `/etc/machine-id` |
| OS | Name, version | `runtime.GOOS`, `/etc/os-release` |
| Kernel | Version | `uname -r` |
| cpm | Version | embedded at build time |
| Network | IP address | Socket bound during connection |
| Owner key | Public key, fingerprint | `--key` flag or default `~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub` |

### Server-Side Rules

Rules evaluate the signup profile and decide approval. Rules are stored in S3 and configurable by registry operators.

```yaml
# rules/signup-rules.yaml
rules:
  # Hardware minimums
  - field: machine.hardware.ram_mb
    operator: gte
    value: 1024
    action: approve
    reason: "Minimum 1 GB RAM required"

  # OS allowlist
  - field: machine.software.os
    operator: in
    value: ["linux", "darwin"]
    action: approve
    reason: "Supported operating systems"

  # Key type restriction
  - field: owner.key_type
    operator: in
    value: ["ssh-ed25519"]
    action: approve
    reason: "Only ed25519 keys accepted"

  # Known owner allowlist
  - field: owner.fingerprint
    operator: in
    value: ["SHA256:known_trusted_key..."]
    action: approve
    reason: "Trusted publisher"

  # TPM required for high-trust publishing
  - field: machine.hardware.tpm
    operator: equals
    value: true
    action: approve
    reason: "TPM present — hardware-rooted trust"

  # Default: queue for review
  - default: true
    action: review
    reason: "No matching rules — queued for review"
```

**Rule operators:**

| Operator | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `equals` | Exact match |
| `not_equals` | Inverse match |
| `in` | Value in list |
| `not_in` | Value not in list |
| `gte` | Greater than or equal (numeric) |
| `lte` | Less than or equal (numeric) |
| `contains` | String contains substring |
| `regex` | Regular expression match |

**Approval states:**

| State | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `approved` | Machine + owner passed all rules. Can register keys and publish. |
| `pending` | No matching rules, or default action is `review`. Queued for admin review. |
| `rejected` | Machine or owner failed a rule. Cannot register or publish. |

### CPM Client Changes

| Command | Status | Change |
|---------|--------|--------|
| `cpm signup` | **New** | Gathers machine profile + owner key, signs, sends to server |
| `cpm auth status` | **New** | Checks signup approval status |
| `cpm auth register` | **Modified** | Now checks signup status before registering key |
| `cpm publish` | **Unchanged** | Still uses SSH key signing |

### Ephemeral Design

Per the principle of no credential storage:

- `cpm signup` is a **one-shot command** — gathers profile, sends, gets response
- No tokens stored locally on the machine
- `cpm auth register` and `cpm publish` continue using SSH keys (ephemeral signing)
- The server stores the profile and approval status in S3
- The machine re-signs every request (no session tokens)
- Profile is re-gathered on each `cpm signup` call (not cached)

### What Changes vs. Today

| Aspect | Today | After ADR-009 |
|--------|-------|---------------|
| Who can register keys | Any machine | Only approved machines |
| Identity | SSH key only | Machine profile + owner key |
| Approval | None (instant) | Rule-based auto-approval or manual review |
| Accountability | Key fingerprint only | Machine profile + owner identity |
| Gate between register and publish | None | Signup → approval → register → publish |

### Rejected Alternatives

| Alternative | Why rejected |
|-------------|-------------|
| Email + password accounts | Obsolete human-centric identity. Not suitable for machine-first systems. |
| GitHub OAuth | Same as email/password — derives identity from a third-party human account. |
| Hardware TPM-only identity | Platform-dependent, not all machines have TPM. Too restrictive. |
| IP-based trust only | IPs change, NAT makes them unreliable as identity. |
| No owner, machine-only | No accountability — who is responsible if the machine misbehaves? |

## Consequences

### Positive
- Supply chain security: only vetted machines can publish
- Accountability: owner identity ties machines to responsible humans
- Machine-native: identity is what the machine IS, not what it stores
- Ephemeral: no credentials to leak, no sessions to manage
- Configurable: rules can be tuned per deployment

### Negative
- Friction: new publishers must wait for approval (mitigated by good default rules)
- Complexity: server needs rule engine and machine profile storage
- Privacy: machine hardware profile is sent to registry (mitigated by: this is a publishing flow, not a browsing flow)

### Risks
- Rule misconfiguration could block legitimate publishers (mitigated by: manual review fallback)
- Machine profile can be spoofed (mitigated by: TPM attestation, network origin checks)
- Owner key compromise (mitigated by: key rotation, re-signup flow)
